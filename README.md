# SCALE
This is a casual mobile game built on unity. The game was built as a part of a project with the [PSI lab, TAMU](https://psi.engr.tamu.edu/)

SCALE is a very addictive infinite game where the player chops of the game field using the randomly generated directional chopping tools at the bottom of the screen. The game proceedes to the next level when the user chops a percentage of the field. The game gets more challenging gradually as the player moves on to the higher levels. This happens as a result of the number of balls in the field increasing as well as the speed of the ball. The balls call be killed when a area with the ball inside it is chopped off. The images below show how the game looks. If any of the balls hit the divider rays, you will loose a life. 
The game is insanely satisfying and super addictive.

The game in this repository was used in conjuection with [zephyr bioharness ](https://www.zephyranywhere.com/) to build an android application that reacts to your physiological modalites such as 'breathing rate' and 'heart rate variability'. The game was used as a tool to help people teach the skill of stress self regulation using deep breathing. The game difficulty level changes with your physiological state such that it helps you keep your calm to play the game and in the process internalize the skill of deep breathing.
